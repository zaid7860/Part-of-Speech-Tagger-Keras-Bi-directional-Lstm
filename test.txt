Much more than shelter , housing symbolizes social status , a sense of `` belonging '' , acceptance within a given group or neighborhood , identification with particular cultural values and social institutions , feelings of pride and worth , aspirations and hopes basic to human well-being .

For almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as self-evident by most Americans .

Few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders .

This pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying their$ professional ethics ; ; it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country .

It is not surprising that , as spokesman for real estate interests , the National Association of Real Estate Boards ( NAREB ) and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure .

How does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race , religion or ethnic attachment ? ?

What does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest ? ?

What ought to be , what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change ? ?

What social , ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation ? ?

Recently , a group of the faculty at Wesleyan University's Public Affairs Center sought some answers to these questions .

Several New England realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers , political scientists , economists , social psychologists , social ethicists and theologians .

Here , in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism , each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it .

For a number of years , Wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body , attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy .

This article presents our observations of that session , of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them .

Such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most realtors .

Within the membership of this group , as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations , the most ready portrayal of oneself to `` the public '' is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them .

Professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner .

But as conversation goes on , particularly among the realtors themselves , another image emerges , that of considerable power and influence in the community .

Obviously , much more than customer expectation is determining the realtor's role .

Judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers' income , educational level and above all , racial extraction ; ; and whether these would qualify them for `` congenial '' , `` happy '' relations to other people in certain community areas .

Obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of `` professional '' with narrow skills and specialization , the effective servicing of a client , rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one's work .

These men -- for the most part educated in our `` best '' New England colleges , well established financially and socially in the community -- under kindly but insistent probing , reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve , or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a `` client-service relationship '' .

This narrow `` professionalism '' does not even fit the present realities of their situation , as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase .

As our discussion continued , the inadequacy of the `` client relationship '' as an interpretation of their `` way of operating '' became evident .

Realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work , as members of social and professional organizations , as citizens and civic leaders , as church laymen , as university alumni , as newspaper readers , etc. .

From such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding .

It seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas : ( 1 ) the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue ; ;

( 2 ) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes ; ;
and , most pervasively , ( 3 ) their interpretation of who is a `` real pro '' , of what it means to be a professional man in a technical , fragmented society .
